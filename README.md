#Libva-utils Project

libva-utils is a collection of tests to exercise VA-API in accordance
with the libva project. A driver implementation is necessary to properly
operate.

VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which
provides access to graphics hardware acceleration capabilities
for video processing. It consists of a main library and
driver-specific acceleration backends for each supported hardware 
vendor.

If you would like to contribute to libva, check our [Contributing
guide](https://github.com/01org/libva-utils/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We also recommend taking a look at the ['janitorial'
bugs](https://github.com/01org/libva-utils/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AJanitorial)
in our list of open issues as these bugs can be solved without an
extensive knowledge of libva-utils.

We would love to help you start contributing!
